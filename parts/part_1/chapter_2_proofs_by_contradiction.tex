\section{Proving Negative Statements}
The direct method is not very convenient when we need to prove a negation of
some statement.

For example, we may try to prove that $78 n + 102 m = 11$ does not have integer
solutions. It is not clear how to prove it directly since we can not consider
all possible $n$ and $m$. Hence, we need another approach. Let us assume that
such a solution $n, m$ exists. Note that $78 n + 102 m$ is even, but $11$ is
odd. In other words, an odd number is equal to an even number, it is impossible.
Thus, the assumption was false.

Let us consider a more useful example, let us prove that if $p^2$ is even, then
$p$ is also even ($p$ is an integer). Assume the opposite i.e. that $p^2$ is
even but $p$ is not. Let $p = 2b + 1$\footnote{Note that we use here the
statement that an integer $n$ is not even iff it is odd, which, formally
speaking, should be proven.}. Note that $p^2 = (2b + 1)^2 = 2(2b^2 + 2b) + 1$.
Hence, $p^2$ is odd which contradicts to the assumption that $p^2$ is even.

Using this idea we may prove much more complicated results e.g. one may show
that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. For the sake of contradiction, let us assume
that it is not true. In other words there are $p$ and $q$ such that
$\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$ and $\frac{p}{q}$ is an irreducible fraction.

Note that $\sqrt{2} q = p$, so $2q^2 = p^2$. Which implies that $p$ is even
and $4$ devises $p^2$. Therefore $4$ devises $2q^2$ and $q$ is also even. As
a result, we get a contradiction with the assumption that $\frac{p}{q}$ is an
irreducible fraction.

\begin{template}
  \textbf{Template for proving a statement by contradiction.} \\

  Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that \textit{the statement} is false.
  Then \textit{present some argument that leads to a contradiction}. Hence, the
  assumption is false and \textit{the statement} is true.
\end{template}

\begin{exercise}
  Show that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
\end{exercise}

\section{Proving Implications by Contradiction}
This method works especially well when we need to prove an implication.
Since the implication $A \implies B$ is false only when $A$ is true but $B$ is
false. Hence, you need to derive a contradiction from the fact that $A$ is true
and $B$ is false.

We have already seen such examples in the previous section, we proved that
$p^2$ is even implies $p$ is even for any integer $p$. Let us consider another
example. Let $a$ and $b$ be reals such that $a > b$. We need to show that
$(ac < bc) \implies c < 0$. So we may assume that $ac < bc$ but $c \ge 0$. By
the multiplicativity of the inequalities we know that if $(a > b)$ and $c > 0$,
then $ac > bc$ which contradicts to $ac < bc$.

A special case of such a proof is when we need to prove the implication
$A \implies B$, assume that $B$ is false and derive that $A$ is false which
contradicts to  $A$ (such proofs are called proofs by contraposition); note
that the previous proof is a proof of this form.

\section{Proof of ``OR'' Statements}
Another important case is when we need to prove that at least one of two
statements is true. For example, let us prove that $ab = 0$ iff $a = 0$ or
$b = 0$. We start from the implication from the right to the left. Since if
$a = 0$, then $ab = 0$ and the same is true for $b = 0$ this implication is
obvious.

The second part of the proof is the proof by contradiction. Assume $ab = 0$,
$a \neq 0$, and $b \neq 0$. Note that $b = \frac{ab}{a} = 0$,
hence $b = 0$ which is a contradiction to the assumption.
