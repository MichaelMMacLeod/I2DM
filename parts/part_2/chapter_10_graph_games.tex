\chapter{Graph Games}
This section gives an alternative definition of a combinatorial game.
This definition allows us to study general combinatorial games.
\begin{definition}
  A directed graph $G$ is a pair $(V, N)$ such that $F$ is a non-empty set and
  $F : V \to 2^V$.\footnote{We are going to have a more in-depth discussion
  of graphs in \Cref{part:graph-theory}.}

  We say that a game on $G$ is the game where elements of $V$ are positions
  and each player can move from $x \in V$ to any $y \in N(x)$. (Elements of
  $N(x)$ are called followers of $x$.)
\end{definition}

For example, the take-away game from \Cref{chapter:combinatorial-games}
can be considered as a graph on a graph $G = (\N_0, N)$,
where $N(0) = \emptyset$, $N(1) = \set{0}$, $N(2) = \set{0, 1}$, and
$N(n + 3) = \set{n, n + 1, n + 2}$ for any $n \in \N_0$.

The key ingreadient for the analisis of games based on graphs was proposed
by Sprague and Grundy. They proposed to consider the following function:
\begin{definition}
  Let $G = (V, N)$ be a directed graph. A function $g : V \to \N$ is the
  Sprague--Grundy funciton for $G$ iff
  $g(x) = \mex\set[y \in N(x)]{g(y)}$, where
  $\mex S = \min \set[n \notin S]{n \in \N_0}$.
\end{definition}
