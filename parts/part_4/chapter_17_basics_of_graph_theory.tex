\chapter{The Definition of a Graph}
In this chapter we start a very important topic in discrete mathematics, which
became even more important with the rise of cimputers, we start the discussion
of graph theory. Graphs are used in mathematics and computer science to describe
networks, maps, and dependencies of objects.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{graph} $G$ is a pair $(V, E)$ such that $E \subseteq V^2$.
  We say that $G$ is \emph{unordered} iff $(u, v) \in E$ iff $(v, u) \in E$ for
  any $u, v \in V$. Otherwise the graph is \emph{ordered}.
  We say that a graph does not have \emph{loops} iff $(u, u) \notin E$ for any
  $u \in V$.
\end{definition}
A graph is \emph{simple} iff it has no loops and its unordered.

It is very convinient to draw graphs using pictures like this.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (v1) at (0,0) {\tiny A};
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (v2) at (0,1) {\tiny B};
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (v3) at (1,1) {\tiny C};
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (v4) at (-1,2) {\tiny D};

    \draw (v1) -- (v2);
    \draw (v1) -- (v3);
    \draw (v2) -- (v4);
    \draw (v2) -- (v3);

  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
In this picture, each circle corresponds to a vertice and each line corresponds
to a an edge; i.e. this diagram describes the graph
\[
  (\underbrace{\set{A, B, C, D}}_V,
  \underbrace{\set{(A, B), (A, C), (B, C), (B, D)}}_E).
\]
(Note that there are multiple ways to draw a diagram for a graph.)

To talk about graphs we need to fix the vocubulary.
An edge is said to \emph{connect} its endpoints; two vertices that are
connected by an edge are called \emph{adjacent}; and a vertex that is an
endpoint of a loop is said to be \emph{adjacent to itself}. An edge is said to
be \emph{incident} on each of its endpoints, and two edges incident
on the same end point are called \emph{adjacent}. A vertex on which no edges
are incident iscalled \emph{isolated}.

One of the most important examples of graphs are complete graphs defined as
follows.
\begin{definition}
  Let $n$ be a natural number. A complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted
  $K_n$,\footnote[][-2cm]{%
    Some sources claim that the letter K in this notation stands for the German
    word komplett, but the German name for a complete graph, vollst\"{a}ndiger
    Graph, does not contain the letter K, and other sources state that the
    notation honors the contributions of Kazimierz Kuratowski to graph theory.
  } is a simple graph with $n$ vertices and exactly one edge connecting
  each pair of distinct vertices.
\end{definition}

\section{Operations on Graphs}
Quite often in order to prove a theorem we need to modify a graph. The most
often operations are the following five. Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph,
$F \subseteq E$ be a set of edges, $U \subseteq V$ be a set of edges,
$e \in E$ be an edge, and $v \in V$ be a vertex.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $G[U]$ denotes the graph $(U, \set[e \in U^2]{e \in E})$,
    $G[U]$ is called the induced subgraph of $G$ on the vertices $U$;
  \item $G[F]$ denotes the graph $(V, F)$, $G[F]$ is called the induced
    subgraph of $G$ on the edges $F$;
  \item $G - e$ denotes the graph $(V, E \setminus \set{e})$, we say that we
    remove the edge $e$ from $G$;
  \item $G - v$ denotes the graph
    $(V \setminus \set{v}, E \cap (V \setminus \set{v})^2)$, we say that we
    remove the vertex $v$ from $G$.
\end{enumerate}
