\chapter{Universal Functions}
It is known that we may write a program that gets another program as an argument
and run it. (Such programs are known as interpreters.) To use this observation
we give the following definition.
\begin{definition}
  Let $U$ be an algorithm. We say that $\Algorithm{U}$ simulates an
  algorithm $\Algorithm{A}$ on an argument $x$ iff
  \[
    \Algorithm{U}(x, y) = \Algorithm{A}(y)
  \]
  for any $y \in \N$. (The equality means that if one of the algorithms
  terminates the other terminates as well, and they return the same number.)
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
  There is an algorithm $\Algorithm{U}$ such that for any $x \in \N$
  and algorithm $\Algorithm{A}$
\end{theorem}
