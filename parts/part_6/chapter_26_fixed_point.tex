\chapter{Fixed Point Theorem}
Probbaly one of the most surprinsg phenomenon in the world of esoteric 
programming is existence of quines, the programs that print themself.\marginurl{%
  Probably the most impresive example of a quine is Quine Relay, a Ruby program
  that generates Rust program that generates Scala program that generates
  \dots (through 128 languages in total)\dots REXX program that generates the
  original Ruby code again.

This chapter proves existence of such programs in almost all programming
languages.

\begin{theorem}[Kleene 's Fixed Point Theorem]
  Let $h : \N \to \N$ be a total computbale function, and let $U : \N^2 \to \N$
  be a G\"odel universal function. Then there is $n \in \N$ such that $U_n$ is
  equal to $U_{h(n)}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $\N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $U : \N^2 \to \N$ be a G\"odel universal function. Then there is $n \in
  \N$ such that $U(n, x) = n$ for all $x \in \N$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Let $q : \N \to \N$ be a computable total function such that $U(q(n), x) = n$
  for all $x \in \N$ (such a function exists since $U$ is a G\"odel universal
  function). Note that there is $n$ such that $U_n$ is equal to $U_{q(n)}$ which
  implies that $U(n, x) = U(q(n), x) = n$ for all $x \in \N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that there is a program on the programing of your choice that prints its
  text backwards.
