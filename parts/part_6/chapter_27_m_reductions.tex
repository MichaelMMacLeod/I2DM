\chapter{m-Reductions}
In the proofs of \Cref{theorem:halting,theorem:undefined-functions}, to prove
that a set $S$ is undecidable we proved that $S$ is decidable iff an undecidable
set $K$ should be also decidable, which lead to the conclusion that $S$ is
undecidable. This was done using ``reduction'' argument. We constructed a total
computable function $f : \N \to \N$ such that $f(x) \in S$ iff $x \in K$ for all
$x \in \N$. In
this chapter we will study this method in more details.

\begin{definition}
  Let $A, B \subseteq \N$. We say that $A$ is \emph{$m$-reducible} to
  $B$\footnote{%
    The letter ``m'' here stands for ``many-to-one''; however, Sipser's
    ``Introduction to the Theory of Computation'' suggests to use call such
    reductions ``mapping reductions'' giving another life for the letter $m$ in
    this notation.
  }
  ($A \le_m B$) if there is a total computable function $f : \N \to \N$ such
  that $x \in A$ iff $f(x) \in B$ for all $x \in \N$. We say that $f$
  \emph{$m$-reduces} $A$ to $B$.
\end{definition}

This notion allows us to translate properties from one set to another.
\begin{theorem}
  Let $A, B \subseteq \N$ such that $A \le_m B$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $B$ is decidable, then $A$ is decidable.
    \item If $B$ is enumerable, then $A$ is enumerable.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $A, B, C \subseteq \N$. Show that
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $A \le_m A$, and 
    \item if $A \le_m B$ and $B \le_m C$, then $A \le_m C$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}
  In the class of enumerable sets, there are sets maximal with respect to
  $m$-reducibility; i.e., there is a set enumerable set $B$ sucht that $A \le_m
  B$ for any enumerable set $A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  A set $B$ maximal with respect to $m$-reducibility is called
  \emph{$m$-complete for the set of enumerable sets}.
\end{definition}
